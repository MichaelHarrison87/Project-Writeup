ILSVRC 2017 image classification winner: Squeeze-and-excitation networks https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01507
Squeeze: global-average pooling over the full height-and-width for each channel of a representation. Results is therefore a scalar for each channel. Seen as capturing the global information about the image carried in each channel ("global information embedding").
Excitation: captures channel-wise dependencies; mutliplies the result of the squeeze op by some new weight matrix W1 (and takes a ReLU). Then dampens this signal by mutliplying the result of that operation by another weight matrix W2 and taking the sigmoid. Size of the weight matrices dictated by number of channels, and some dimension-reduction hyperparameter r. This is again done channel-wise. The result of the sigmoid, s, is then multiplied with the corresponding channel of the original representation, essentially rescaling the original representation. Note s is simply a scalar for each channel.
